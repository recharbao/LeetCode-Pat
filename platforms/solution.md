Firstly, we obviously don't need y-coordinates at all because we can place both platforms at y=−∞. Let's sort all x-coordinates in non-decreasing order.

Calculate for each point i two values li and ri, where li is the number of points to the left from the point i (including i) that are not further than k from the i-th point (i.e. the number of such points j that |xi−xj|≤k). And ri is the number of points to the right from the point i (including i) that are not further than k from the i-th point. Both these parts can be done in O(n) using two pointers.

Then let's build suffix maximum array on r and prefix maximum array on l. For l, just iterate over all i from 2 to n and do li:=max(li,li−1). For r, just iterate over all i from n−1 to 1 and do ri:=max(ri,ri+1).

The question is: what? What did we do? We did the following thing: the answer always can be represented as two non-intersecting segments of length k such that at least one endpoint of each segment is some input point (except the case n=1). Now, let's fix this border between segments. Iterate over all i from 1 to n−1 and update the answer with max(li,ri+1). So we took some segment that starts at some point to the left from i (including i) and goes to the left and took some segment that starts further than i+1 (including i+1) and goes to the right. With this model, we considered all optimal answers that can exist.

Time complexity: O(nlogn).
